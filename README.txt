TIGRAMITE â€“ TIME SERIES GRAPH BASED MEASURES OF INFORMATION TRANSFER

Version 2.0 (release date 2016-01-01)

(Python Package)


General Notes:

Tigramite is a time series analysis python module. With flexibly adaptable scripts it allows to detect and quantify causal dependencies from time series and create high-quality plots of the results.


Features:

- Analysis can be performed on one multivariate time series, in sliding windows of one multivariate time series, or an ensemble of multivariate time series

- Flexible Python framework for custom preprocessing like anomalization, high/lowpass filters, masking of samples (e.g. winter months only), and more

- Different (conditional) measures of association (partial correlation, conditional mutual information with different estimators)

- Estimation either from prescribed graph for testing hypotheses OR from iteratively estimated time series graph

- Fast computation through use of C-code via scipy.weave and fully parallelized script (mpi4py package necessary)

- Significance testing via prescribed threshold or sophisticated shuffle test

- Flexible specification of experiment and variable names and units

- Flexible plotting scripts for publication quality presentation of results
