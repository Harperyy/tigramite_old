# TIGRAMITE â€“ TIME SERIES GRAPH BASED MEASURES OF INFORMATION TRANSFER

Version 2.0 beta (release date 2016-04-12)

(Python Package)


## General Notes:

Tigramite is a time series analysis python module. With flexibly adaptable scripts it allows to reconstruct graphical mode from time series, quantify interaction strengths with different measures, and create high-quality plots of the results.


## Features:

- Analysis can be performed on multivariate time series. Further scripts allow sliding windows or ensemble analyses

- Flexible Python framework for custom preprocessing like anomalization, high/lowpass filters, masking of samples (e.g. winter months only), and more

- Different (conditional) measures of association (partial correlation, conditional mutual information with different estimators)

- Fast computation through use of C-code via scipy.weave and fully parallelized script (mpi4py package necessary)

- Significance testing via analytical tests, a prescribed threshold or a shuffle test for conditional mutual information

- Flexible specification of experiment and variable names and units for plots

- Flexible plotting scripts for publication quality presentation of results
