# TIGRAMITE â€“ TIME SERIES GRAPH BASED MEASURES OF INFORMATION TRANSFER

Version 2.0 beta (release date 2016-04-15)

(Python Package)


## General Notes

Tigramite is a time series analysis python module. With flexibly adaptable scripts it allows to reconstruct graphical models (conditional independence graphs) from discrete or continuously-valued time series based on a causal discovery algorithm, quantify interaction strengths with different measures, and create high-quality plots of the results.


## Features

- Analysis can be performed on multivariate time series. Further scripts allow sliding window or ensemble analyses

- Functions for custom preprocessing like anomalization, high/lowpass filters, masking of samples (e.g. winter months only), time-binning, ordinal pattern analysis, and more

- Different (conditional) measures of association (partial correlation, standardized regression, and conditional mutual information with different estimators)

- Fast computation through use of C-code via scipy.weave; also fully parallelized script (mpi4py package necessary) available

- Significance testing via analytical tests or a shuffle test for conditional mutual information

- Flexible plotting scripts for publication quality presentation of results

## Usage

Edit one of the tigramite_analysis_*.py template files to load your data and choose parameters. Also create a folder for your results (the default folder is 'test/'). Then run as

$ python tigramite_analysis_template_beta.py

The results pickle file and figures will be saved in the specified folder.
